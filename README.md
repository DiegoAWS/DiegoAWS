## About me

Hey, I'm Diego Escobarâ€”a full-stack engineer with over 10 years diving headfirst into code, DevOps, and SRE. I didn't take the traditional path; back in 2015, I ditched the classroom for real-world coding, teaching myself everything.

It's been a wild ride: From building a warehouse control system that slashed inventory costs by $450K, yeah, I felt that amazing! Leading app for MakerDAO company in Estonia, where I helped orchestrate a cross-state launch across 15 US states and more than 45 different engineering team during a 160% growth spurt, productivity for 400+ engineers team a 16% growth spurt.

What fires me up? Solving tough problems with real impact.

Fluent in Spanish (native), English, and French. I'm all about innovation and adaptability. Let's chat about how I can bring that energy to your next big thing, drop me a line!
